MODEL-BASED QUANTIFICATION OF INDUCED GENE EXPRESSION TIME COURSES

We present a model of gene expression time courses following induction of a glucocorticoid receptor-bound
transcription factor into the nucleus after exposure to dexamethasone in Arabidopsis thaliana. As opposed
to single-time measurements of induced expression, which result in a single "up" or "down" fold-change
value at some point in time, typically long after the induction event, our model reproduces the dynamics
of transcription factor transport into the nucleus followed by the transcriptional dynamics of its primary
(direct) and secondary (indirect) targets. The model quantifies an observed time course with two rate
coefficients: one quantifies the initial normalized rate of rise or fall of target mRNA levels, the other
quantifies mRNA loss. These two processes compete to determine the final transcript fold change: a highly-
induced transcript may saturate at a low fold change if it also decays quickly, while weakly induced
transcripts may rise to a high level if they have very low loss. We present analysis of experiments with
transcription factors involved in leaf regulation: ASYMMETRIC LEAVES 2, REVOLUTA, KANADI 1, SHOOT
MERISTEMLESS and TINY. Since secondary targets of the induced transcription factor are expected to rise
with some delay, during which the primary transcript's protein levels rise, we explore the use of our model
to discern between primary and secondary target time courses.
